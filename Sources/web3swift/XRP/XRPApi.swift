    ///   - account: The unique identifier of an account, typically the account's Address. The request returns channels where this account is the channel's owner/source.

    ///   - ledgerIndex: The sequence number of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See Specifying Ledgers)
    ///   - limit: Limit the number of transactions to retrieve. The server is not required to honor this value. Must be within the inclusive range 10 to 400. Defaults to 200.
